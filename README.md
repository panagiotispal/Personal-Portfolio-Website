This is a dynamic Personal Portfolio Website designed to showcase my software development journey, technical skills, and professional experience. Unlike traditional static portfolios, this application is built as a full-stack project using Python and the Flask micro-framework.

The core functionality relies on a MySQL database to store and manage project data, which is then dynamically fetched and rendered using Jinja2 templating. This architecture demonstrates my ability to integrate backend logic with frontend design, manage database connections efficiently, and build responsive web applications from scratch. The interface is styled with custom CSS to ensure a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
